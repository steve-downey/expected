;;; orgit-file-transclusion.el --- transclude UUID-anchored regions at a git rev  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
;; SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception

;; Provenance: docs/epistolary-pinning-plan.md (section 3), shared across
;; compile-time-scheme sibling repositories by copy, not by load-path coupling.
;;
;; Link form: [[orgit-file:REPO::REV::PATH::UUID]]
;; Used with: :lines 2- :src LANG :end "UUID end"   (unchanged conventions)
;;
;; Where the sibling `orgit:' adapter in init.el resolves PATH against the
;; worktree -- showing the file as of now -- this one resolves it against REV,
;; so an epistolary post keeps showing the code its prose was written about.
;; REV is normally an annotated `blog/phase-NN' tag; see docs/blog/pins.md.
;;
;; No magit dependency: the blob comes from a `git show' subprocess, so batch
;; export stays light. The interactive `orgit-file' package (gggion/orgit-file)
;; uses the same link syntax, so installing it makes these links followable in
;; a live Emacs, but nothing here requires it.

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Implementation note -- why this extracts a blob to a file instead of
;; slicing the region itself:
;;
;; `org-transclusion-add-src-lines' already implements the exact semantics the
;; posts depend on, and they are fiddlier than they look.  `:end' is EXCLUSIVE
;; of the line holding the end marker; `:lines 2-' counts forward from the
;; anchor line found by the search option, not from the top of the file; and
;; `:src cpp' wraps the result in a fenced block.  Reimplementing that slicing
;; would duplicate three behaviours that must not drift.
;;
;; So this adapter mirrors `org-transclusion-add-orgit': it materialises the
;; pinned blob, rewrites the link in place into a plain `file:' link with the
;; same `::UUID' search option, and returns nil so the standard src-lines
;; handler does the work.  Post attributes keep meaning exactly what they
;; meant under worktree resolution -- by construction, not by imitation.
;;
;; The blob is written under a path that preserves the original repo-relative
;; path, so `find-file-noselect' picks the same major mode it would have for
;; the real file.  `org-link-search', which resolves the `::UUID' anchor, is
;; mode-sensitive, so this is what keeps anchor resolution identical.
